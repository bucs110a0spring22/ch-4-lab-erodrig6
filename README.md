## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: 
All changes were made using comments so that the changes are visible.
- Eliminated redundencies in functions called. The drawSineCurve function was called more than once before proper set up of the window was completed and that has now been fixed.
- Eliminated redundencies in the setup of the window. The setupWindow function was being given parameters that were either not used or not needed.
- Code that had set the speed or shape of the turtle object were commented out so that the two added functions would work as intended.

Summary of function(s) added: 
The added function asks the user what shape they would like their turtle to be using corresponding numbers. After the shape is selected, the code prints what the new shape is and uses it to draw sin, cos, and tan curves. 

Summary of Feature Added: 
Added a function in which changes the speed the turtle draws sin, cos, and tan line. It can be any speed bewtween 1 and 10, which is chosen by the user of the code.
